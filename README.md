# PepperSeedNeuralNet
This is a research project I'm working on in my spare time. The goal is to be able to identify different cultivars of pepper seeds with an RGB image. Currently, I am scanning seeds with a Canon LIDE 300 flatbed scanner at 2400dpi, with black construction paper as a background. See the PDF of the research poster for further details on the accuracy I've achieved. Next steps is to scan a lot more seeds so that we have a larger data set (current data set is 1922 images of individual seeds). In the future, I may expand it beyond the 8 cultivars I currently have. If you're interested in helping, or would like my dataset or compiled models, feel free to reach out jon.eman184 at gmail.
